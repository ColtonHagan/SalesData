Project Idea: Analyzing Sales Data with Pandas

In this project, you'll work with a small dataset of sales data and use pandas to analyze and visualize the data. Here are the steps to complete the project:

1. Download and import the sales data into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Clean the data by removing any duplicates and handling missing values.
3. Compute some basic statistics on the data, such as the total sales, average sales per day, and maximum sales for a single day.
5. Visualize the sales data using pandas and matplotlib, such as creating a line chart showing the daily sales over time.
6. Use pandas to group the data by various categories, such as by product or by store, and compute summary statistics for each group.
6. Export the cleaned and analyzed data to a new CSV file for future use.
